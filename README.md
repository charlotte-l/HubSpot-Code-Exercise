<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[<img src="/exercise-2.gif">](https://github.com/charlotte-l/HubSpot-Code-Exercise)

This is my solution to the HubSpot Code Exercise. It's comprised of two parts:

* A styled testimonial block using fixed predefined HTML markup, using SASS for styling
* A media library, which pulls data from an external API and displays it. The library is searchable and filterable

I chose to use React 17 for building the media library interface. I additionally implemented linting with ESLint and Prettier, and unit tests with React Testing Library.



### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
* [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project uses Parcel 2 for asset bundling. To run the development server or production builds, ensure npm 7+ / node 14+ are installed on the system.

To see if you already have Node.js and npm installed and check the installed version, run the following commands:

```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

If you need to update your node version to the latest stable version, you can use [n](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n).


### Prerequisites

* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* Node 14.0.0+

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HubSpotWebTeam/CodeExercise.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```
